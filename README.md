# Isilmo
 
Isilmo is a 2D platformer game which I developed with Unity Engine in 2018.

The player controls the wizard named Isilmo (hence the game's name) and needs to either fight or avoid the enemies he encounters on the way from the one side of the map to the other. The player can attack with primary fireball projectile or alternate lightning strike, regenerate mana and health by picking up potions and increase his game score by picking up coins and diamonds.

Isilmo was my first attempt at game development, pixelart and music writing.

The game features [Arcade Classic font by Pizzadude](https://www.dafont.com/arcade-classic-2.font).
